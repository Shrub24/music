# **RESEARCH NOTES**


## **Fourier Transform**
* [Intuition and reasoning for general Fourier Transform formula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)
* [Implementation for music recognition](https://www.toptal.com/algorithms/shazam-it-music-processing-fingerprinting-and-recognition)
* [More details about implementation of FFT](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/28/understanding-the-fft/)
* [Cooley-Tukey FFT Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm)




## **Machine Learning Music Classification**
* [Various machine learning models used by Spotify to recommend music](https://medium.com/@sophiaciocca/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe)
* [DIY Convolutional Neural Network example](http://mattmurray.net/building-a-music-recommender-with-deep-learning/)
* [Detailed example of DIY Collaborative Filtering Model using Matrix Factorisation](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-simple-song-recommender-296fcbc8c85)




## **Other Things**
* Need to find a sufficiently large dataset with metadata and some mp3s
* Need to decide on depth of implementation (whether to use libraries such as numpy etc. to simplify algorithms)
